# Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.
# In other words, if the number of positive integers in nums is pos and the number of negative integers is neg, then return the maximum of pos and neg.

# Note that 0 is neither positive nor negative.

class Solution:
    def maximumCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        neg = bisect_left(nums, 0)
        pos = len(nums) - bisect_right(nums, 0)
        return max(neg, pos)
