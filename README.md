# **My LeetCode Solutions Repository**
Welcome to my personal repository of LeetCode solutions. In this repository, I've compiled my python3 solutions to various problems from LeetCode in the course of my preparation for technical interviews.

The purpose of this repository is to document the improvement of my problem-solving skills, and to serve as a resource for anyone else who is on a similar journey.

## **Repository Structure**
This repository is structured as follows:

Each common DS/Algorithm skill I have solved problems under has its own directory (e.g. binary_search, greedy, etc). Each problem from LeetCode I have solved has its own file, named as problemnumber_problemname (e.g., 15_3sum.py).
