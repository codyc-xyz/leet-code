# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

# For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
