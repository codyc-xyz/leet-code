# There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

# You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given an integer array restricted which represents restricted nodes.

# Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.

# Note that node 0 will not be a restricted node.
