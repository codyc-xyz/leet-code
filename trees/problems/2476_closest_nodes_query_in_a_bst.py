# You are given the root of a binary search tree and an array queries of size n consisting of positive integers.

# Find a 2D array answer of size n where answer[i] = [mini, maxi]:

# mini is the largest value in the tree that is smaller than or equal to queries[i]. If a such value does not exist, add -1 instead.
# maxi is the smallest value in the tree that is greater than or equal to queries[i]. If a such value does not exist, add -1 instead.
# Return the array answer.
