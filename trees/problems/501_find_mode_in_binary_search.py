# Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

# If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.

# Assume a BST is defined as follows:

# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
