# Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

# The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

# Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

# Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.
