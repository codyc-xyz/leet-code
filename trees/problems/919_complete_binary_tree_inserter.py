# A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

# Design an algorithm to insert a new node to a complete binary tree keeping it complete after the insertion.

# Implement the CBTInserter class:

# CBTInserter(TreeNode root) Initializes the data structure with the root of the complete binary tree.
# int insert(int v) Inserts a TreeNode into the tree with value Node.val == val so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted TreeNode.
# TreeNode get_root() Returns the root node of the tree.
