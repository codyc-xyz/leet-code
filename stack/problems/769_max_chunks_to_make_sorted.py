# You are given an integer array arr of length n that represents a permutation of the integers in the range [0, n - 1].

# We split arr into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

# Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.
