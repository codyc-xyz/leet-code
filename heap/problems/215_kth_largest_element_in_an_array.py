# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

# Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

# You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(nums)

        while len(nums) > k:
            heapq.heappop(nums)

        return nums[0]
