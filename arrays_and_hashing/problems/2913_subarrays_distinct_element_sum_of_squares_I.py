# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

# The distinct count of a subarray of nums is defined as:

# Let nums[i..j] be a subarray of nums consisting of all the indices from i to j such that 0 <= i <= j < nums.length. Then the number of distinct values in nums[i..j] is called the distinct count of nums[i..j].
# Return the sum of the squares of distinct counts of all subarrays of nums.

# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

class Solution:
    def sumCounts(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        seen = set()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            seen = set()
            for j in range(i, len(nums)):
                seen.add(nums[j])
                ans += len(seen)**2
        return ans
